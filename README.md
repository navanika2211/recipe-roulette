## 📌 Project Objective

RecipeRoulette is a full-stack web application designed to help users stop cooking the same meals repeatedly and reduce food waste.  

The application allows users to manage both their **recipes** and **ingredient inventory**, then intelligently determine:

- What recipes can be cooked immediately  
- Which recipes are missing only 1–2 ingredients  
- What ingredients need to be purchased  
- How close ingredients are to expiration  

The project demonstrates full-stack development using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** while following clean architecture, modular organization, and modern web development best practices.
